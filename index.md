## Mission Deep Sunday RaceDay

Welcome to the race!

Every Sunday at 2PM ET the Club MissionDeep racers get together to play Forza Horizon 5.
You can join the [MissionDeep Discord](https://t.co/uQa7fOuaKp) to find out more. 

## Getting started

We race in a convoy in FH5. To join a convoy in the game, you need to
play through some of the game. How much? Like most things in FH5,
no one who gets there cares enough to remember. It's a mystery of
apathy. Just plan to play the game solo for an hour or so to unlock
online play.

This will also help you to get a little cash for buying cars.
Every week one of the racers picks the car we all drive, and someone
else builds a tune that we all apply to the car.

## Joining a convoy

The best way to join the convoy is to make friends. Did we mention you
get all this and friends too? Once you're in the discord sunday-raceday
channel at race time, ask for a invite and someone will oblige.

## Streamers

Several racers stream the race. Check out there profiles, and drop in
sometime to experience the madness.
